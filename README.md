# <img src="_assets/icon.png" width="20"> vault

> authentication and authorization system developed to provide a secure, single sign-on experience </h4>

The idea behind **one** is a "double OAuth2" flow, where `vault-auth` is the OAuth2 provider \
for `vault-proxy` and Google is the OAuth2 provider for `vault-auth`.

[one](https://github.com/andikaleonardo/vault) is built on top of Bitlyâ€™s open source [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy)
